Case 1: Open Book > Retrieved > Closed Book,What is the name of the model that is trained using a large unlabelled corpus?,The name of the model that is trained using a large unlabelled corpus is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).,"The name of the model that is trained using a large unlabelled corpus is a language model. A language model is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on a large amount of text data to learn the statistical patterns and relationships between words. It is typically trained on unlabelled text data, such as books, articles, or web pages, to predict the probability of a sequence of words occurring. Language models are widely used in various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.","The model that is trained using a large unlabelled corpus is referred to as ""Large unsupervised language models (LMs)"" [1, 2]. These models are trained on very large datasets and acquire surprising capabilities [1, 2]."
Case 2: Open Book < Retrieved < Closed Book,What is the difference between in-context learning and traditional machine learning?,"The passage does not directly mention the difference between in-context learning and traditional machine learning. It primarily discusses various approaches and techniques related to in-context learning. Therefore, based on the given passage, we cannot determine the specific difference between in-context learning and traditional machine learning.","In-context learning and traditional machine learning are two different approaches to solving problems using artificial intelligence. 

Traditional machine learning typically involves training a model on a large dataset that is representative of the problem domain. The model learns patterns and relationships in the data and uses this knowledge to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. The training and inference phases are typically separate, and the model is expected to generalize well to new data.

On the other hand, in-context learning is a more dynamic and adaptive approach. It focuses on learning and making decisions in real-time, within the context of a specific task or environment. In-context learning systems continuously learn and update their knowledge based on the feedback and interactions they receive from the environment. This allows them to adapt and improve their performance over time.

One key difference between in-context learning and traditional machine learning is the level of human involvement. In traditional machine learning, humans play a crucial role in curating and labeling the training data, selecting the appropriate algorithms, and fine-tuning the model parameters. In contrast, in-context learning systems are designed to learn and adapt autonomously, with minimal human intervention.

Another difference is the feedback loop. In traditional machine learning, the feedback loop is typically limited to the evaluation of the model's performance on a test dataset. In-context learning, however, involves a continuous feedback loop with the environment, where the system receives feedback and updates its knowledge in real-time.

Overall, in-context learning is more suited for dynamic and evolving environments where the problem or task may change over time. Traditional machine learning, on the other hand, is better suited for static problems where the data distribution remains relatively stable.","In-context learning and traditional machine learning differ in their approach to training and generating models. In traditional machine learning, models are trained on a large dataset and then used to make predictions or generate outputs based on new inputs. On the other hand, in-context learning involves training models in a specific context or domain, using prompts and examples that are relevant to that context [1].

One key difference between in-context learning and traditional machine learning is the way prompts are used. In traditional machine learning, prompts are typically generic and not specific to a particular domain. In contrast, in-context learning relies on prompts that are tailored to the specific context or domain in which the model will be used [1].

Another difference lies in the training data. In traditional machine learning, models are trained on a diverse range of data from various domains. In contrast, in-context learning focuses on training models on data that is specific to the target domain or context [1].

Additionally, the evaluation of models also differs between in-context learning and traditional machine learning. In traditional machine learning, models are evaluated based on their performance on a general benchmark or test set. In-context learning, however, evaluates models based on their performance in the specific context or domain for which they were trained [1].

In summary, the main difference between in-context learning and traditional machine learning lies in their approach to training, prompts, training data, and evaluation. In-context learning focuses on training models in a specific context or domain, using tailored prompts and domain-specific data, while traditional machine learning takes a more general approach, training models on diverse data and evaluating them on general benchmarks [1].

Case 3: Retrieved > Open Book > Closed Book,What is the name of the technique that allows users to provide a reference image that serves as a target for generation?,"The technique that allows users to provide a reference image that serves as a target for generation is called ""providing a reference image.""","The technique that allows users to provide a reference image that serves as a target for generation is commonly known as ""image-to-image translation"" or ""image-to-image synthesis."" This technique involves training a machine learning model to generate an output image that is similar to the reference image provided by the user. It is often used in various applications such as style transfer, image inpainting, and image super-resolution.","The technique that allows users to provide a reference image that serves as a target for generation is called ""conditional image generation"" [1]. This technique enables users to specify the desired output by providing an input image, which serves as a reference for generating new content. By conditioning the generation process on the reference image, the model can generate content that aligns with the characteristics and style of the provided reference [2]. This technique has been widely used in various applications, such as image synthesis, style transfer, and image-to-image translation [3].
