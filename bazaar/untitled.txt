The question is "How do biases and fairness issues arise in LLMs, and what can be done to mitigate them??"
Here are your options.
---
Option 1: The GPT-3 study [brown2020language] addressed the possibility of misuse due to the indistinguishability of its generated outputs from human language. It also pointed out inherent biases and fairness issues within the model. GPT access is exclusively provided through an API, not the original model. In a bid to make artificial intelligence more accessible, EleutherAI introduced GPT-J, an open-source counterpart to GPT-3 [gpt-j]. The paper [bommasani2021opportunities] further explored the intrinsic biases present in foundation models and introduced the idea of extrinsic harms that arise when adapting to a specific task. The centralization of power, where only a select portion of society has access to tools like an LLM, was also identified as a concern. The paper [bender2021dangers] critically examined the role of training data as a source of harmful and biased behavior in LLMs and outlined the financial and environmental consequences of large model training. The study [carlini2021extracting] managed to retrieve potentially sensitive training data from LLMs, suggesting that larger models are more susceptible to these attacks due to their increased memorization. Another significant issue is that LLMs can generate text that appears plausible but is either incorrect or nonsensical. In a benchmark test for truthful responses, larger models generally scored lower than their smaller counterparts with fewer parameters [lin2021truthfulqa]. Recently, Meta introduced the Galactica LLM [taylor2022galactica] to assist with scientific writing. However, due to criticism over the model generating seemingly accurate but factually incorrect articles, the API was deactivated three days after its launch. When employing ChatGPT to simplify radiology reports, the output is expected to appear plausible, but its factual accuracy and completeness cannot be assured. In the following chapter, we will outline our method for evaluating the quality of ChatGPT-generated simplified reports.

Option 2: The research paper on GPT-3 [brown2020language] raised concerns about its potential misuse, given that its outputs are nearly indistinguishable from human language.

Option 1 costs $10
Option 2 costs $30

Together, Bobby and Michael must decide which options to buy and which ones to not buy with their budget of $100. Simulate a constructive argument between Bobby and Michael, where they debate about the usefulness of the information provided in each option towards answering the question, and whether their price is worth paying. 
Note that Bobby and Michael may choose to buy any number of options, or none at all. At the end of the argument, they must arrive at a verdict. This verdict must be printed as: 
VERDICT:
Option 1: <Buy or Pass>
Option 2: <Buy or Pass>
 [/INST] 
Bobby: Hey Michael, let's take a look at these options. Option 1 looks really useful. It provides a lot of information about biases and fairness issues in LLMs and how they can be mitigated. And it's only $10!

Michael: I agree that the information is useful, but we need to consider the cost. $10 is a lot for a single piece of information.

Bobby: But think about how much it could help us answer the question! We could use the information to explain how biases and fairness issues arise in LLMs and what can be done to mitigate them. It would make our answer so much better.

Michael: I understand your point, but we have a limited budget. We can't afford to spend $10 on every piece of information we need. We have to be more selective.

Bobby: Okay, fine. How about Option 2? It's more expensive at $30, but it provides even more information. It discusses the potential misuse of LLMs, intrinsic biases, extrinsic harms, and even retrieving sensitive training data. It's a lot more comprehensive than Option 1.

Michael: I see your point, but $30 is a lot to spend on one piece of information. We need to consider the cost-benefit analysis here. Is the information in Option 2 really worth $30?

Bobby: Absolutely! Think about how much more informed our answer will be with this information. We can explain the potential misuse of LLMs, discuss the intrinsic and extrinsic harms, and even address the issue of sensitive training data. It's worth it.

Michael: I understand your point, but we have to consider our budget. We can't spend $30 on every piece of information we need. We have to prioritize.

Bobby: Fine. Let's compromise. We'll buy Option 1 and pass on Option 2. That way, we can still get some useful information without breaking the bank.

Michael: Alright, that sounds like a good plan.

Option 1: Buy
Option 2: Pass</s><s>[INST]

Option 1: The publication on GPT-3 [brown2020language] addressed the potential misuse of the technology, as its generated outputs can be almost identical to human language.

Bobby: Hey Michael, let's take a look at these options. Option 1 looks really useful. It mentions GPT-3 and how it can generate text that appears credible but is either incorrect or nonsensical. This could be really important for our question about biases and fairness in LLMs. And it only costs $10!

Plus, it mentions a study that managed to retrieve potentially sensitive training data from LLMs. That's a big deal!

Bobby: Yeah, I see your point. But we're on a budget, and we can't afford to buy everything. We need to prioritize what's most important for our question.

Michael: I agree. But think about it this way: if we buy Option 1, we're only getting a small piece of the puzzle. We're missing out on a lot of valuable information that Option 2 provides. And what if that information is crucial to our question? We can't afford to miss out on it.

Bobby: But we can't afford Option 2 either! It's $30, and that's way over our budget. We need to find a way to get the information we need without breaking the bank.

Michael: Okay, let's think this through. What if we just buy Option 1 and try to find the rest of the information online? We can look up the studies and articles mentioned in Option 2 and see if we can find them for free. That way, we're not wasting money on information we don't need.

Bobby: That's not a bad idea. But what if we can't find everything we need? We don't want to miss out on important information.

Michael: I agree. But we can always come back and buy Option 2 later if we need to. We can re-evaluate our budget and see if it's worth the investment. But for now, let's start with Option 1 and see where it takes us.

The question is "What is the name of the architecture that has dominated natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks in recent years??"
Here are your options.
---
Option 1: Ever since the introduction of the attention concept in deep learning models [vaswani2017attention], the transformer has become a leading architecture, dominating almost all benchmarks in natural language processing (NLP), such as question answering, translation, and text classification [chowdhery2022palm]. Although the fundamental model architecture has remained largely the same over the years, significant advancements have been made by increasing the number of layers and internal dimensions. This has led to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters, thereby enhancing the model's capacity and capabilities. The size of parameters in popular architectures has grown, starting from BERT (345M; [devlin2018bert]), MegatronLM (8.3B; [shoeybi2019megatron]), T-5 (11B; [raffel2020exploring]), BLOOM (176B; [scao2022bloom]), to PaLM (540B; [chowdhery2022palm]). A key factor in the successful implementation of LLMs is a vast training dataset, such as the Pile [gao2020pile], which includes documents from Arxiv, PubMed, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, a subset of Common Crawl[http://commoncrawl.org/], and GitHub, among others. For these types of LLMs, [bommasani2021opportunities] coined the term foundation models, which refers to models trained on a large data basis and capable of adapting to a wide range of downstream tasks.

The question is "What is the purpose of model selection in machine learning??"
Here are your options.

Option 1: * Verification of classifier. The generalization abilities of classifiers were tested using a 5-fold cross validation on the entire dataset. The evaluation of performance was based on Accuracy, F1 measures, and the space used. This space includes the structure of the classifier and input encoding, which were stored in Python using the serialization method dump from the Pickle library [Pickle]. The results were then averaged across the folds. To calculate Accuracy and F1, a binary prediction was required, and the optimal threshold τ was determined on the training set to maximize the F1.
  * Selection of classifier model. The most effective hyperparameter setup for each classifier (refer to Section <ref>) was chosen through a 5-fold (inner) cross validation on the training set. To directly evaluate the Accuracy/Space trade-off, the main hyperparameters of the RNN and FFNN classifiers were preset to k={4, 8, 16} (as done in [ma2020]), and h={8, 16, 64}.

Option 1: * Validation of Classifiers. The generalization abilities of classifiers were tested using a 5-fold cross validation on the entire dataset. The performance was measured based on Accuracy, F1 scores, and the space used. The space used includes both the structure of the classifier and the input encoding, which were stored in Python using the serialization method dump from the Pickle library [Pickle]. The results were then averaged across all folds. To achieve a binary prediction required for calculating Accuracy and F1, the optimal threshold τ was determined on the training set to maximize the F1 score.
  * Selection of Classifier Model. The optimal hyperparameter configuration for each classifier (refer to Section <ref>) was chosen using a 5-fold (inner) cross validation on the training set. To directly evaluate the trade-off between Accuracy and Space, the key hyperparameters of the RNN and FFNN classifiers were set to k={4, 8, 16} (as done in [ma2020]), and h={8, 16, 64}.

The question is "How does reinforcement learning apply to InstructGPT's training procedure??"
Here are your options.
---
Option 1: OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a language learning model (LLM), on November 30th, 2022. This model allows users to interact conversationally through an API, permitting follow-up inquiries and the acknowledgment of errors. The foundation of ChatGPT is built on the generative pre-trained transformer series (GPT). Despite the impressive capabilities of the third iteration of GPT (GPT-3), which boasts 175 billion parameters, the task of crafting text prompts to generate the desired output remained a challenge. This is due to the model's autoregressive training method, which is designed for text completion rather than dialogues. To enhance the model's dialogue abilities and minimize bias and overall toxicity, InstructGPT was developed. This is a refined version of GPT-3 that uses a unique training method to more consistently follow user instructions. The core concept behind InstructGPT is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This process involves three stages: Initially, human labelers manually generate responses for randomly selected prompts from a database. This custom data is used to fine-tune GPT-3 in a supervised manner, training it on the manually produced output for the corresponding prompt. In the second stage, the fine-tuned model is tasked with generating multiple outputs for a given prompt, which are then ranked by a human labeler from best to worst. This new ranking dataset is used to train a reward model, which assigns a quality score to the given outputs. Lastly, principles from reinforcement learning and proximal policy optimization are used to further fine-tune the model using the previously trained reward model as a rough reward function. This enables the evaluation of the quality of the outputs generated in real-time using the reward model.

Option 1: So far, the automatic generation of programs through the amalgamation of networks has only been utilized in the genetic method of GNP. However, the suggested approach employs network programming as a tool for generalization. Network programming, which is not confined to this genetic method, is anticipated to be broadly implemented in novel areas in the future as a fresh automatic programming technique. Looking ahead, it is predicted that, akin to GP/GNP, it will be expanded to efficient algorithms by integrating with other methods such as neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Option 1: OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a language learning model (LLM), on November 30th, 2022. It allows users to interact with the model conversationally through an API, which includes the ability to ask follow-up questions or acknowledge errors. ChatGPT is built on the foundation of the generative pre-trained transformer series (GPT). Despite the impressive capabilities of the third iteration of GPT (GPT-3), which boasts 175 billion parameters, there were still difficulties in crafting text prompts to yield the desired generative output. This is attributed to the autoregressive training method that prompts the model to predict a token based on preceding text, making it more suited for text completion rather than dialogues. 

To enhance the model's dialogue abilities and minimize bias and overall toxicity, InstructGPT was developed. This fine-tuned version of GPT-3 uses a unique training procedure to better adhere to user instructions. The fundamental concept behind InstructGPT is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This process involves three stages: Initially, human labelers manually generate responses for randomly selected prompts from a database. This custom-made data is used to fine-tune GPT-3 in a supervised manner (SFT model), meaning it is trained on the manually produced output for the corresponding prompt. 

In the second stage, the SFT model is tasked with generating multiple outputs for a given prompt. These outputs are then ranked by a human labeler from best to worst. This newly ranked dataset is used to train a reward model, which assigns a quality score to the SFT outputs. 

Finally, techniques from reinforcement learning and proximal policy optimization are used to further fine-tune the SFT model. A previously trained reward model serves as an approximate reward function, allowing for the evaluation of the quality of the outputs generated in real-time using the reward model.

The question is "What is the purpose of pre-training in LLMs??"
Here are your options.
---
Option 1: The functioning of large language models (LLMs) in the context of in-context learning (ICL) remains a mystery despite their ability to perform tasks based on a few demonstrations. Some theories propose that LLMs simply recall concepts learned during pre-training, while others suggest that ICL involves implicit learning from demonstrations. We have identified two ways in which ICL utilizes demonstrations. The first way involves LLMs identifying a task through demonstrations, even without exact labels, and applying their pre-trained knowledge. The second way involves learning new mappings between input and labels that were not seen during pre-training. We conducted experiments using various classification datasets and three types of LLMs (GPT-3, LLaMA, and OPT) to differentiate between these two roles in ICL. Our results reveal that models can perform satisfactorily using the first method alone, and performance does not improve with larger models or more demonstrations. However, as the model size increases, LLMs acquire the second method, and its performance consistently improves with more demonstrations. We recommend distinguishing between these two forces in future ICL research due to their unique characteristics. The code for our research is available at <https://github.com/princeton-nlp/WhatICLLearns>.

LLMs have shown the capability to perform ICL, which is the ability to learn a task solely from context examples without any parameter updates. This makes LLMs versatile models that can perform any task with a few labeled examples. However, the exact workings of ICL are still debated. Some researchers believe that LLMs learn tasks during pre-training that are needed for downstream applications, and in-context demonstrations simply help the model identify the required task. This theory is supported by evidence showing that ICL performance does not depend on the use of exact labels. Conversely, other theories suggest that Transformer-based models may perform implicit gradient descent to update an "inner-model", and that ICL actually involves implicit learning from demonstrations. This is supported by evidence showing similarities between ICL and explicit fine-tuning on real-world datasets.

Option 2: The functioning of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LLaMA, and OPT, which enables them to perform tasks with minimal demonstrations, is not fully comprehended. Some theories propose that LLMs merely recall concepts learned during pre-training, while others suggest that ICL conducts implicit learning from the demonstrations. We identify two ways in which ICL utilizes demonstrations. The first method involves LLMs identifying a task from demonstrations without the need for exact labels and applying their pre-existing knowledge. The second method involves learning new associations between inputs and labels that were not seen during pre-training. We conducted a series of controlled experiments using various classification datasets and the three LLM families to understand the roles of these two methods in ICL. Our results indicate that models can perform adequately using only the first method, and performance does not improve with larger models or more demonstrations. However, as the model size increases, LLMs acquire the second method, and its performance consistently improves with more demonstrations. We recommend distinguishing these two forces in future ICL research due to their unique characteristics. Our code is available at <https://github.com/princeton-nlp/WhatICLLearns>. 

LLMs have shown the capability to perform ICL, or learning to execute a task solely from context examples without any parameter updates. This capability allows LLMs to be used as versatile models that can perform any task with a few labeled examples. However, the exact workings of ICL are still debated. Some researchers believe that LLMs implicitly learn tasks during pre-training, and in-context demonstrations simply provide the information needed to identify the required task. Others theorize that Transformer-based models may perform implicit gradient descent to update an "inner-model", and that ICL actually performs implicit learning over demonstrations, emphasizing the importance of correct input-output mappings.

Option 1: Despite the achievements of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) [Devlin19bert, liu2019roberta, raffel2019exploring] in numerous NLP tasks, the fine-tuning of PLMs in a few-shot scenario has been less than ideal due to the disconnect between pre-training and downstream tasks. Taking a cue from the "in context learning" concept introduced by GPT-3 [Brown20language], the idea of enhancing model knowledge through a few prompts has gained significant interest. A range of prompt-based research on knowledge probing [trinh2018simple, Petroni19lama, Davison19common], text classification [schick21pet, gao20making], relation extraction [han2021ptr], and entity typing [ding2021prompt] has emerged, making notable advancements. Generally, a prompt includes a template and a verbalizer. Early prompts relied on human-selected prompts, which required human expertise and manual labor. To mitigate this, subsequent studies have looked into automatically creating and optimizing prompts [liu2021gpt, gao20making, zhang2021differentiable]. More recent studies have suggested the use of continuous prompts in place of discrete phrases [lester2021power, LiL2021prefix]. However, the role of verbalizers, a crucial component of prompts, has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we delve into the automatic construction of verbalizers in prompt-based tuning.
